Building from source in Windows is much more compilcated because satisfying the dependecies is more of a challenge with out the help of Debian's package system.  You can build everything from source or you can find prebuilt libraries for some of the dependencies.  You should build or download binaries of the following, in order:

  * SCons http://www.scons.org/
  * OpenSSL http://www.openssl.org/
  * Boost http://www.boost.org/
  * V8 http://code.google.com/p/v8/ 
  *
